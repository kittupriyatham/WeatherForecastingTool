# WeatherForecastingTool
## Introduction
1. This is a weather forecasting tool that can be used to predict the weather of a particular location.
2. The tool uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch the weather data.
3. The tool uses the data fetched from the API to show the current weather of the location.
4. This is a command line tool that can be called as a command with city name as argument in the form 
`python weather.py <city_name>`.
5. This tool is created as a part of the Hackathon conducted by [**_TECHGIG_**](https://www.techgig.com/codegladiators/github-copilot-hackathon) as a part of Code Gladiators 2023. This Hackathon is conducted in association with GitHub and Microsoft.
